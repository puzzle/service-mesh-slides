### Service Mesh Definition

A service mesh is a decentralized application networking infrastructure among your services that provides resiliency, security, observability, and routing control.

### Service Mesh & API Gateway Differences

 API Gateway:
  * Is focused on business functionality
  * Handles external client-to-service communication
  * Abstracts and decouples service implementations

### Service Mesh & API Gateway Differences

Service Mesh:
  * Is focused on network
  * Handles internal service-to-service communication
  * Provides details about service implementations

---

<!-- .slide: class="text-left" -->
### Unique API Gateway capabilities

* Boundary decoupling
* Tight control over data are allowed in and out
* Bridging security trust domains

---

<!-- .slide: class="text-left" -->
### API Gateway Boundary Decoupling

* Request / response transformation
* Application protocol transformation like REST/SOAP/XSLT
* Error / Rate limit custom responses
* Direct responses, e.g. blocked clients/requests
* Precise control over api/proxy pipelining
* API composition/grouping

### Do I Need a Service Mesh?

You may need one if:
* You're using a microservices architecture
* And youâ€™re deploying to a cloud platform
* And implement services with different languages/frameworks

### Service Mesh Tradeoffs

* Increased resource usage
* Increased latency
* Increased operations complexity
